Front-End Developer – Take Home Assignment
Create a dashboard in angular where the user can view, create, edit, and delete notes. Notes should
have both a title and content. New notes can be created via a form at the top of the screen, and notes can
either be directly editable in the dashboard, or via a dialog. The dashboard should be responsive to
screen size. Feel free to use any libraries. Don’t spend more than 4 hours on this exercise: the point is to
see how you code rather than to get as much functionality as possible. Please submit as either a link to
an accessible git account, or a zip file (make sure not to include node_modules).
